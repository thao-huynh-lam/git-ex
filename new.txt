Creating a Branch from a Tag

Much like creating a branch from a commit, you can also create a branch from a tag. This is especially useful since tags are, in my opinion, a better way to reference a certain point in a project's history.

So if you have created tags throughout your project's history, you can create a new branch just like before, but with a tag as the identifier.
